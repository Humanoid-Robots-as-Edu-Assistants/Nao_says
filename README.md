# "NAO says" for NAO6 Robot [v.1.0]
*This project supports 2 languages. It is available in german and english!*<br>

### How the Game works

The game "NAO says" (based on Simon says) was developed for the "Long Night of Science Berlin" in 2022. <br>
Before you start the program, you can choose in which language Nao the game starts automatically. <br>
(You can also set how many tasks Nao plays with the participants if you wish.) <br>
The robot briefly explains that if he says "Nao says: [Task]" you should imitate him <br>
and if he doesn't say "Nao says" you shouldn't. After that, Nao plays the game with the participants. <br>
75% of the time he says "Nao says" before a task. A maximum of 10 tasks are currently available. <br>
These are run through in random order and are not repeated.

### What do you need?

You just need your Robot.

### Plans of further development:

We are currently not planning any further development. <br>
Of course, the program can be expanded to include additional tasks.
